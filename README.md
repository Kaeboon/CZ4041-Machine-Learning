I implemented Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, both seems to not perform very well. This is due to me using pixels value as the feature. There is still room for improvement.

Also credits to my teammates: Hon Wei, Charmaine and Micole for doing the Data Preprocessing, and submission to csv portion~
