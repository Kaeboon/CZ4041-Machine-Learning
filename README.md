Code for the competition: Northeastern SMILE Lab - Recognizing Faces in the Wild

I implemented Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, both seems to not perform very well.
K-means clustering is also implemented, but accuracy is lower.
CNN neural network, including RESNET50, InceptionV3 and VGGFace are too implemented, these perform much better and were used as the final submission.

Also credits to my teammates: Hon Wei, Charmaine and Micole for working on the Data Preprocessing, CSV outputting, K-means clustering, and CNN neural network.
